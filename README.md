 Building a chatbot with Langchain.
Langchain is a framework for building llm Application 

For a Langhchain Chains, there are three components:
LLMs, Prompts,Output Parsers.

I will use any llm for the backend, since langchain support any  variety of llm 

also groq model because it is free

*Prompt is the first step in the chain, it takes dictionary of parameters and returns a string. In this case we are using `ChatPromptTemplate` to create custom prompt template. It takes tuples, where the first element is the role of themessage and the second element is the content of the message.

role can be `system`,`User`,`assistant`or `placeholder`    

*Chain: the chain takes the `prompt` and the  `llm ` and  `outputParser` and the  `response`. This is the most basic since we have a variable in the prompt that will be filled by the user and then the llm. In langchain every chain has the  function called `invoke` that takes dictionary of variables and returns its response

*outputParser
outputParser is used to parse the AI message in a `readable` format using the `StrOutputParser`.
